•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project involved creating a program that reads the temperature data from the given Fahrenheit folder, which then converts those temperatures to Celsius while writing the converted temperatures to the output file.

•	What did you do particularly well?

I thought I did a good job with the structured approach of the code as it uses appropriate variables to store the city name, original temps, and converted temps. I also thought my uses of comments provided enough explanation for the purpose of the different sections of code as they made it more understandable, especially for future me to look.

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Error handling would’ve been a nice way to enhance my code. Such as checking if the files were successfully opened before proceeding as this would help prevent crashes due to file access issues.

•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Off the top of my head one of the most challenging parts of working on this code was implementing the .txt files as I never had done that before. After being frustrated for some time, I took to google and did some research on how to add and work with the .txt files and quickly got familiar with them. Using online resources liked to google are key parts of problem solving for me as I continue to learn.

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

File input and output operations is something that will be transferable to future projects. Understanding how to read data from files, process it, and then write the results back is a skill applicable to any type of project involving data, processing, and more.

•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

For maintainability something I try to work on is separation of concerns when creating code. Spitting up different tasks into distinct sections, such as the file reading, temperature conversion, and file writing, makes the code easier to locate and modify specific functionalities without affection others. Finally, as for readability I added descriptive comments throughout the program
