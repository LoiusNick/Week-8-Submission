•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project involved creating a program that reads the temperature data from the given fahrenheit folder, which then converts those temperatrues to Celsious while writing the 
converted temperatures to the output file.
•	What did you do particularly well?
I thought I did a good job with the structured approach of the code as it uses appropriate variables to store the cirty name, original temps, and converted temps. 
I also thought my uses of comments provided enough explanation for the purpoise of the different sections of code as they made it more understandble, especially for furtre me to look 
back at.
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
