CS-255: Entry: Reflecting on the DriverPass Project

Project Summary
The DriverPass project involved designing a comprehensive training and scheduling system for DriverPass, a company that helps people prepare for their driving tests. The client, represented by DriverPass’s owner and IT officer, wanted a system that would allow customers to book and manage driving lessons, take online practice tests, and track their progress. My role in this project was to gather all of the business requirements in a document and, later, to create a system design that addressed the client’s needs and provided a reliable, user-friendly interface.

What I Did Well
I believe I did particularly well in analyzing the client’s requirements and creating clear, organized documentation for the system. In the business requirements document, I made sure each requirement was thoroughly detailed, ensuring that both functional and nonfunctional requirements were addressed. In the system design phase, I also feel I did a good job creating diagrams that visually communicated how the system would function, which helped make the design easier to understand and implement.

Potential Revisions
If I could choose one part of my work to revise, it would be the user interface specifications. While I focused on ensuring the system’s core functions were fully developed, I think I could have expanded on the user interface and user experience details to make the interface even more intuitive. Adding more mock-ups or design suggestions might help provide a better sense of the user journey and make the system easier to navigate.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
To interpret the user’s needs, I started by carefully reviewing the client’s requirements and understanding the pain points that users might experience. I prioritized creating a system that was easy to navigate and ensured that all core functions were straightforward, like scheduling lessons or taking practice tests. Considering the user’s needs is essential because the system must be practical and efficient for its intended users. By focusing on user-friendliness and functionality, I aimed to design a system that users would find helpful and easy to adopt.

Approach to Designing Software
In approaching software design, I focus on gathering detailed requirements first to understand the full scope of the project. Moving forward, I would continue to use structured analysis techniques and visual diagrams, like UML diagrams, to lay out the system. I would also incorporate user feedback and testing earlier in the design phase to make adjustments based on real interactions. In the future, I plan to apply iterative design strategies to continuously refine the system based on feedback, ensuring it aligns with both client expectations and user needs.
