•	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I Interpret user needs by understanding their specific requirements and translating them into actionable tasks. User stories facilitate this process by breaking down user needs into manageable chunks, maintaining focus on the user's perspective, and prioritizing features accordingly. Through the use of user stories, I can closely collaborate with stakeholders, ensuring alignment with user expectations while also delivering a positive user experience.

•	How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I prioritize understanding the projects’ requirements and breaking tasks into more manageable steps. After learning agile processes, I aim to incorporate processes such as Scrum in order to help with organizing tasks through Sprint Planning, unsure regular communication, gathering feedback, and reflecting. By using Agile methodologies, I will add to collaboration among team members, adapt more effectively to changing project requirements, and ultimately deliver higher quality solutions.

•	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means effectively communicating, collaborating, and problem-solving with peers. This also includes having adaptability to changing circumstances, and a commitment to continuous learning in order to stay updated on new technologies. Most importantly, good team members respect their colleagues, create a supportive environment, and contribute positively to the team's success by sharing knowledge and expertise.

•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project involved creating a program that reads the temperature data from the given Fahrenheit folder, which then converts those temperatures to Celsius while writing the converted temperatures to the output file.

•	What did you do particularly well?

I thought I did a good job with the structured approach of the code as it uses appropriate variables to store the city name, original temps, and converted temps. I also thought my uses of comments provided enough explanation for the purpose of the different sections of code as they made it more understandable, especially for future me to look.

•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Error handling would’ve been a nice way to enhance my code. Such as checking if the files were successfully opened before proceeding as this would help prevent crashes due to file access issues.

•	Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

Off the top of my head one of the most challenging parts of working on this code was implementing the .txt files as I never had done that before. After being frustrated for some time, I took to google and did some research on how to add and work with the .txt files and quickly got familiar with them. Using online resources liked to google are key parts of problem solving for me as I continue to learn.

•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

File input and output operations is something that will be transferable to future projects. Understanding how to read data from files, process it, and then write the results back is a skill applicable to any type of project involving data, processing, and more.

•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

For maintainability something I try to work on is separation of concerns when creating code. Splitting up different tasks into distinct sections, such as the file reading, temperature conversion, and file writing, makes the code easier to locate and modify specific functionalities without affection others. Finally, as for readability I added descriptive comments throughout the program
